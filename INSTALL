INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    - Ensure you have a working Python setup. 
      Code has been tested on Python 2.7, not Python 3 yet.
      You may wish to set up a development environment (I like conda)

    - Ensure you have a working C compiler (i.e. gcc) to build the extensions.

    - Install mandatory python modules using either easy_install, pip, or conda
	cython, numpy, tqdm, natsort, joblib, itertools

    - Install optional python modules to provide further compatibility/enhancement
        imageio (movie formats)
        pillow (conventional image file formats)

    - If installing movie support via imageio, also need ffmpeg
       use package manager (apt, yum) in Linux or homebrew in macos

    - Install ImageMagick
      Use package manager (apt, yum) in Linux or use homebrew on MacOS
      (nb. Homebrew requires Xcode and the Command Line Tools). 

    - Install additional PythonMagick dependencies once ImageMagick is installed.
      We require 'boost-python' and python2.5 or later, as well as working c/c++ compilers. These can be obtained through package manager (Linux) or homebrew on MacOS.
      
      On Linux you also need to install 'libmagickcore-dev' and 'libmagick++-dev'.
      On MacOS you also need to install 'pkg-config'.

    - Install PythonMagick
      (get source from https://github.com/ImageMagick/PythonMagick or clone 
      with `git clone https://github.com/ImageMagick/PythonMagick.git')
      
      Build the module with ./configure; make; make install. 
      This code has been tested with ImageMagick 7.0.7-30 Q16 x86_64 

      nb. On MacOS w/ python 2.x I had weird compiler errors when boost-python wasn't installed 
       - it didn't warn during configure!
      nb. I'm using miniconda2 dev environment and had to manually modify Makefile to point    
      these to the right site-packages:
         pyexecdir = /Users/dduke/miniconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages
	 pythondir = /Users/dduke/miniconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages 

      nb. on MacOS, 'make install' may put the libraries in the wrong place (i.e. the usual Linux location for site-packages).
         I fixed this by doing sudo mv /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/PythonMagick /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/ 

      nb. I have not yet got PythonMagick to work under python 3.x on MacOS - some problem
      with the Boost libraries. Should work on Linux, though.

    - Check that the above modules load without errors
        cd; python2.7 -c 'import PythonMagick'
        If you have trouble, Stack Oveflow is your friend!

    - Now go to pySciCam and run 'python setup.py install'
      n.b. if you don't have sudo permission to install the packages for the system, append the --user switch to install locally.

    - Go into 'pySciCam/test' and run ' python run_tests.py ' to check all is working ok.
